    """Convert arrays to Fortran format.

    This function takes a number of array objects in `args` and converts them
    to a format that can be directly passed to a Fortran function (Fortran
    contiguous NumPy array). If the arrays have different data type, they
    converted arrays are cast to a common compatible data type (one of NumPy's
    `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128` data types).

    If `overwrite` is ``False``, an NumPy array that would already be in the
    correct format (Fortran contiguous, right data type) is neverthelessed
    copied. (Hence, overwrite = True does not imply that acting on the
    converted array in the return values will overwrite the original array in
    all cases -- it does only so if the original array was already in the
    correct format. The conversions require copying. In fact, that's the same
    behavior as in SciPy, it's just not explicitly stated there)

    If an argument is ``None``, it is just passed through and not used to
    determine the proper data type.

    `prepare_for_lapack` returns a character indicating the proper
    data type in LAPACK style 'SDCZ' and a list of
    properly converted arrays.
